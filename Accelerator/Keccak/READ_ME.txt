README file

-py:	python scripts needed for the verification.

- src:	a folder in which the VHDL source files. For now, it is exactly the Keccak sponge function, designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen,  Michaël Peeters and Gilles Van Assche.
	For more information, feedback or questions, please refer to our website: http://keccak.noekeon.org/, VERSION 3.1

- tb:	a folder with all the test-benches. 
	One test bench is dedicated to the permutation, it reads from the test_vectors directory the perm_in.txt file and produces a file perm_out_high_speed_core_vhdl.txt.
	The output of the vhdl test bench has to be compared with the perm_ref_out.txt generated by the reference code

	The second test bench reads input from the keccak_in.txt file and writes the results to the file keccak_out_high_speed_vhdl.txt, to be compared
	with the keccak_ref_out.txt

- test_vectors:	


- code:	 a copy of the reference code, where the files provided by Bertoni team.
	KeccakPermutationReference.c and KeccakPermutationReference.h have been changed in order to produce test vector easily readable in the vhdl testbenches.
	Three functions have been added in these files
		1) KeccakPermutationIntermediateValuesForVHDL: 
			This function creates intermediate values for testing the Keccak_f permutation; It writes the input of the permutation to the file perm_in.txt
			and the output of the permutation to the file perm_ref_out.txt
			Ten applications of the permutation are used as test bench.
		2) Keccak_testvector_for_VHDL:
			This function generates test vectors readable in vhdl for the complete hash function, in this case limited to r=1024 and d=0 (Keccak_f). It writes the test vectors in keccak_in.txt and keccak_ref_out.txt. 
			The file keccak_in.txt contains as a first line the number of inputs, each input is separated from the next by the â€“ character, while the . character is used as end of inputs
			4000 messages are generated with random length. This function calls a third function 
		3) printPad_enc_Msg_rate1024_d_0:	for generating the padding of the message according to the spec of Keccak.
